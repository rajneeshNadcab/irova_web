            <h5>Overview</h5>
            <p>
              The "Irova" App: A cutting-edge platform designed specifically for
              the crypto-enthusiastic community. Our users are not just familiar
              with cryptocurrency; they are deeply embedded in the crypto
              ecosystem, as evidenced by their unique method of accessing our
              platform – through their crypto wallets. This not only signifies a
              high level of understanding and involvement in the cryptocurrency
              world but also indicates a user base that is actively engaged and
              potentially more receptive to crypto-related advertising.
            </p>
            <p>
              Target Audience: "Irova" app users are distinguished by their
              advanced knowledge of blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, and
              related financial systems. This audience includes but is not
              limited to crypto traders, blockchain developers, digital currency
              enthusiasts, fintech professionals, and tech-savvy individuals who
              are always on the lookout for the latest trends in the crypto
              world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unique Environment for Advertisers: By choosing to advertise on
              "Irova", businesses and individual advertisers gain access to a
              niche but highly engaged and knowledgeable audience. This is not a
              general consumer base; it's a specialized group with specific
              interests and higher potential for interaction with ads that align
              with their interests in the cryptocurrency and blockchain secto
            </p>
            <p>
              User Trust and Quality Experience: The "Irova" app values the
              trust and experience of its users. Therefore, we ensure that all
              advertisements are not only relevant but also maintain the quality
              and integrity of the user experience on our platform. Our
              selective advertising approach prioritizes user engagement and
              satisfaction, making "Irova" an ideal place for advertisers who
              want to reach a targeted, crypto-savvy audience.
            </p>
            <h5>Exclusive Advertising Access:</h5>
            <div style={{ paddingLeft: "30px", paddingTop: "10px" }}>
              <h5>Premium Membership and Channel Requirement:</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Selective Advertising Privileges:</strong> In the
                  "Irova" app ecosystem, the right to advertise is an exclusive
                  benefit reserved for premium members and owners of premium
                  groups/channels. This policy is designed to ensure that
                  advertisers themselves are actively involved and invested in
                  the crypto community, thereby enhancing the relevance and
                  quality of the advertisements.

                  {" "}
                  <strong> Quality Control:</strong> By restricting advertising
                  access to premium entities, "Irova" maintains a high standard
                  of ad content. Premium members and channel owners are more
                  likely to understand the unique dynamics and preferences of
                  the app's user base, leading to more effective and engaging
                  advertisements.
                </li>

              <h5>Advantages of Premium-Only Advertising:</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Enhanced User Trust:</strong> Users are assured that
                  the advertisements they see come from sources that are
                  well-versed in the crypto world, and not from random or
                  unrelated advertisers. This builds a level of trust and
                  relevance in the ads presented.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Targeted Impact:</strong> Advertisements from premium
                  members or channels are more likely to align with the
                  interests and needs of the "Irova" app's user base. This
                  targeted approach not only benefits the advertisers with
                  better engagement rates but also enhances the overall user
                  experience by providing them with ads that are more likely to
                  be of interest.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Sustained Engagement:</strong> Premium advertisers,
                  being part of the community themselves, are better positioned
                  to create long-term engagement strategies with their ads,
                  fostering a more interactive and sustained relationship with
                  the audience.
                </li>

              <h5>Ensuring Advertiser Quality:</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Vetting Process:</strong> To become a premium member
                  or to own a premium channel, individuals or entities undergo a
                  vetting process. This ensures that those who are granted
                  advertising rights uphold the standards and values of the
                  "Irova" community.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Feedback and Improvement:</strong> Premium advertisers
                  are more receptive to feedback and adaptive to the changing
                  dynamics of the crypto audience, ensuring continuous
                  improvement in the quality and effectiveness of
                  advertisements.

              <h5>Cost Structure:</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Pricing Model:</strong> The "Irova" app employs a Cost
                  Per Thousand Impressions (CPM) model for ad pricing. This
                  model is widely recognized and allows advertisers to pay based
                  on the number of times their ad is shown, with the cost
                  calculated per 1,000 views.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Rate:</strong> The rate is set at $10 equivalent in
                  popular cryptocurrencies like USDT, ETH, BNB, or MATIC per
                  1,000 ad views. This pricing ensures a transparent and
                  straightforward way for advertisers to understand and budget
                  their ad spend.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h5>Cryptocurrency Payment Options:</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Flexible Payment in Crypto:</strong> Recognizing the
                  nature of our audience and the platform, "Irova" accepts
                  payments in various cryptocurrencies including USDT, ETH, BNB,
                  and MATIC. This not only aligns with our user base's
                  preferences but also encourages the use of digital currencies.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Market Equivalence:</strong> The $10 rate is
                  equivalent in the chosen cryptocurrency, calculated based on
                  the current market exchange rate at the time of the
                  transaction. This keeps the pricing fair and
                  market-responsive.

                <li>
                  <strong>Measurable and Scalable:</strong> The CPM model offers
                  a measurable and scalable option for advertisers. They can
                  start with smaller campaigns to test effectiveness and scale
                  up as needed based on performance.

                  <strong>Alignment with Crypto Market Dynamics:</strong>{" "}

                  marketing efforts with their investment and operational
                  currencies, making the process seamless for businesses
                  operating within the crypto and blockchain space.

                  <strong>Enhanced Accessibility for Crypto Businesses:</strong>{" "}
                  By accepting various cryptocurrencies, "Irova" lowers the
                  barrier for crypto-focused businesses to advertise, enabling a
                  broader range of advertisers to participate.

                  to an audience that is more likely to engage with their ads.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Market Adaptability:</strong> The use of dynamic
                  cryptocurrency rates for payment keeps the pricing adaptable
                  to market changes, offering flexibility and real-time value
                  alignment for advertisers.
