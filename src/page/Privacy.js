                      Irova, a cutting-edge decentralized communication app that
                      operates on both Android and iOS platforms, is
                      foundational to its commitment to user privacy and data
                      security. This policy is especially crucial given Irova’s
                      array of services, including chatting, calling, video
                      calling, group chatting, and streaming, all integrated
                      with advanced Web3 and blockchain technologies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      At its core, the policy emphasizes stringent data
                      protection. Irova ensures end-to-end encryption for all
                      user communications, a critical feature for a service
                      operating in the sensitive realm of personal and group
                      communications. Furthermore, the app employs an innovative
                      approach to data storage. Instead of relying on central
                      servers, it stores data off-chain and locally on users'
                      devices, with a synchronization process involving zkEVM
                      (Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine) to bolster
                      security and privacy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      A unique aspect of Irova is its use of Web3 login
                      mechanisms. Users access the app through decentralized
                      Web3 logins via EVM chain wallets. This approach not only
                      enhances security but also promotes user anonymity, as
                      Irova does not require traditional personal information
                      like email addresses or phone numbers for account setup.
                      This method aligns with the app’s philosophy of minimal
                      data collection, where it gathers only the essential
                      information necessary for operational functionality,
                      avoiding any unnecessary storage of sensitive personal
                      data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The Privacy Policy also details the rights of users in
                      managing their data. It empowers users with the ability to
                      access, modify, and delete their information, reflecting
                      the app's user-centric approach to data management. This
                      aspect is particularly vital in an era where data control
                      is increasingly being recognized as a fundamental user
                      right.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Groups and channels, essential features of Irova for
                      community interaction and content broadcasting, are also
                      covered under the policy. These features are managed with
                      a strong emphasis on privacy, ensuring that interactions
                      within these platforms are secured and kept private, in
                      line with the overall security framework of the app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The policy outlines the protocols for any changes,
                      ensuring that users are well-informed and consenting to
                      any updates. This transparency is crucial in maintaining
                      trust and integrity, especially in a service that handles
                      sensitive communication data.{" "}
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Finally, the Privacy Policy provides clear directions for
                      users to contact Irova for support or inquiries, ensuring
                      that channels of communication are always open, reflecting
                      Irova's commitment to responsive and user-friendly
                      service.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In conclusion, the Irova cluster’s Privacy Policy is a
                      comprehensive document that reflects the app’s dedication
                      to upholding high standards in privacy, data security, and
                      ethical data management. It caters to a diverse user base,
                      ranging from those who are tech-savvy and deeply involved
                      in the blockchain and Web3 spaces, to the general public
                      who seek a secure and private digital communication
                      experience. This policy is a testament to Irova’s
                      commitment to leading the way in secure, decentralized
                      communication technologies.

                      <p>
                        The Irova cluster, as detailed in the Overview section of
                        its Privacy Policy, is a unique communication platform
                        that integrates the latest in Web3 and blockchain
                        technologies. It's designed to provide users with a
                        range of communication services, including messaging,
                        voice and video calling, group chats, and streaming, all
                        within a decentralized framework. This approach not only
                        enhances privacy and security but also aligns with the
                        growing demand for more user-controlled digital
                        experiences.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        A key feature of Irova is its decentralized nature,
                        leveraging blockchain technology to offer a more secure
                        and private way of communicating compared to traditional
                        apps. Users log in through a Web3 mechanism using EVM
                        chain wallets, which adds an additional layer of
                        security and user autonomy. This method also means that
                        Irova doesn't require traditional personal data for
                        account creation, enhancing user anonymity.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Irova's commitment to privacy is further emphasized
                        through its use of end-to-end encryption, ensuring that
                        all communications remain private and secure. The app
                        stores data off-chain on users' devices, synchronized
                        with zkEVM for added security, reflecting its focus on
                        user privacy and data sovereignty.

                        The purpose of the Privacy Policy for the Irova cluster, as
                        outlined in section 1.2, is to provide users with a
                        clear and comprehensive understanding of how their
                        personal information is handled within this
                        decentralized communication platform. This section of
                        the policy is crucial as it sets the foundation for the
                        relationship between the app and its users, particularly
                        in terms of data privacy and security.
