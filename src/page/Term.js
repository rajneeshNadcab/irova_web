                <h4>2.Account Registration</h4>
                <p>2.1 Account Creation and Web3 Wallet Login</p>
                <p style={{ paddingLeft: "30px" }}>
                  To access and utilize the full suite of features offered by
                  Ghost, users are required to register an account. Registration
                  is uniquely facilitated through a Web3 wallet login, a
                  decentralized approach that enhances security and user
                  autonomy.
                </p>
                <p>2.2 Web3 Wallet Authentication</p>
                <p style={{ paddingLeft: "30px" }}>
                  Upon registration, users will connect their Ethereum Virtual
                  Machine (EVM) compatible wallet. This wallet serves as your
                  digital identity on Ghost, allowing for a secure and anonymous
                  login experience without the need for traditional
                  username-password combinations.
                </p>
                <p>2.3 Responsibility for Wallet Security</p>
                <p style={{ paddingLeft: "30px" }}>
                  As your Ghost account is intrinsically linked to your Web3
                  wallet, it is imperative that you maintain the security of
                  your wallet credentials. Ghost is not responsible for managing
                  wallet passwords or recovery phrases. Loss or compromise of
                  your wallet credentials may result in unauthorized access to
                  your Ghost account.
                </p>
                <p>2.4 Wallet Compatibility and Updates</p>
                <p style={{ paddingLeft: "30px" }}>
                  Ghost supports various EVM-compatible wallets. It is the
                  user's responsibility to ensure that their wallet is
                  compatible with the app and to manage any updates or changes
                  to their wallet software.
                </p>
                <p>2.5 Data Linked to Your Wallet</p>
                <p style={{ paddingLeft: "30px" }}>
                  Any data or interactions on Ghost linked to your wallet
                  address are under your control. Ghost does not access, use, or
                  store sensitive wallet information beyond what is necessary
                  for authentication and maintaining your account. Your
                  interactions within the app, such as messages or calls, are
                  encrypted and are not linked to your wallet’s public data.
                </p>
                <p>2.6 Account Updates</p>
                <p style={{ paddingLeft: "30px" }}>
                  You are responsible for keeping your account information,
                  including your linked Web3 wallet, up to date. If you change
                  or update your wallet, you must promptly update your account
                  information in Ghost to ensure uninterrupted access to the
                  app.
                </p>
                <p>2.7 Responsibility for Transactions</p>
                <p style={{ paddingLeft: "30px" }}>
                  Transactions or interactions made through your wallet within
                  the Ghost platform are your responsibility. Ghost does not
                  oversee or intervene in wallet-based transactions unless
                  required by law.
                </p>
                <p>2.8 Account Security</p>
                <p style={{ paddingLeft: "30px" }}>
                  We strongly advise you to take all necessary precautions to
                  secure your Web3 wallet, including using secure networks,
                  enabling two-factor authentication where possible, and being
                  vigilant against phishing attempts.
                </p>
                <p>2.9 Decentralization and Autonomy</p>
                <p style={{ paddingLeft: "30px" }}>
                  By using a Web3 wallet for account registration, you embrace
                  the decentralized nature of Ghost. This means you have greater
                  control over your personal data and identity, in line with the
                  ethos of decentralized and blockchain-based platforms.

                  link this information to individual users.

                  behavior patterns is done with the utmost respect for user
                  privacy and in compliance with relevant data protection laws.

                <p>13.1 Indemnity by Users</p>
                <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                  You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Ghost and
                  its affiliates, officers, agents, employees, partners, and
                  licensors from any claim or demand, including reasonable
                  attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out
                  of your content, your use of the Ghost app, your connection to
                  the Ghost app, your violation of these Terms and Conditions,
                  or your violation of any rights of another.
                </p>

                <p>13.2 Scope of Indemnification</p>
                <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                  This indemnification covers all aspects of use, including but
                  not limited to user conduct, content posted, and any violation
                  of another party's rights or laws.
                </p>

                <p>13.3 Procedure for Claim and Indemnification</p>
                <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                  In the event of a claim that necessitates indemnification,
                  Ghost will provide you with notice of the claim. You will then
                  be required to cooperate with us in defending the claim. Ghost
                  reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive
                  defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification
                  by you.
                </p>

                <p>13.4 Limitations on Indemnification</p>
                <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                  While Ghost requires indemnification to cover potential
                  losses, this shall not be construed to absolve Ghost of its
                  own duties and responsibilities as per the terms outlined in
                  this agreement and applicable law.
                </p>

                  These Terms and Conditions, and your use of the Ghost app,

                  of the jurisdiction in which Ghost operates, without regard to

                  and equitable solution satisfactory to both parties.
                </p>

                <p>14.3 Arbitration Process</p>
                <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                  If the parties do not reach such a solution within a period of

                  disputes, claims, questions, or disagreements shall be finally
                  settled by binding arbitration administered by an established
                  alternative dispute resolution provider mutually agreed upon
                  by the parties.
                </p>

                <p>14.4 Waiver of Class Action</p>
                <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                  You agree to resolve any disputes with Ghost on an individual
                  basis and waive any right to a class action or any other
                  collective proceeding.
                </p>

                <p>14.5 Jurisdiction for Legal Disputes</p>
                <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                  Notwithstanding the above, you agree that Ghost shall still be
                  allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent
                  type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.
